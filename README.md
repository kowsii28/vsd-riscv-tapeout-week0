# Task 1: Summary of Video

Summary of the video:

* Firstly, to verify an application, we should write the C program for that and then run it using GCC compiler.  
* Next, implement that same logic using the specification of the processor we are going to use.  
* Then, write the softcopy of the hardware, which is the RTL logic (Verilog).  
* Further, the RTL is classified as:
  * Processor → Synthesizable to provide gate-level netlist.  
  * Peripherals/IPs → Classified as:
    * Macros (Synthesizable)  
    * Analog IPs (Functional)  
* Next step is SoC Integration.  
* Then, RTL → GDS.  
* Finally, it is given to industry to get the chip, which is known as Tapeout.
